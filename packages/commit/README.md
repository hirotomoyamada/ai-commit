## Setup

1. Install

   ```sh
   pnpm add -g @hirotomoyamada/ai-commit
   ```

2. Obtain your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

3. Set your API key in `ai-commit`.

   ```sh
   ai-commit config set apiKey=<your token>
   ```

## Upgrading

To check the installed version, run the following:

```sh
ai-commit --version
```

To install the [latest version](https://github.com/hirotomoyamada/ai-commit/releases), run the following:

```sh
pnpm up -g aicommit --latest
```

## Usage

To generate a commit message, run the following:

```sh
ai-commit
```

> [!TIP]
>
> `ai-commit` provides a shortened alias `aic`.

When you run `ai-commit`, two scenarios may occur:

1. If there are files staged:

   - AI detects the differences in the staged files and generates a commit message.
   - Once you review and approve the generated commit message, it will be committed.

2. If there are changed files not yet staged:

   - A list of changed files will be displayed.
   - You select the files to add to the stage from the list.
   - AI detects the differences in the newly staged files and generates a commit message.
   - Once you review and approve the generated commit message, it will be committed.

> [!TIP]
>
> To add all changed files not currently staged to the stage (with `git add .`), set the `--all` or `-a` option.

### Changing the Commit Message Suggestions

To change the commit message suggestions, set the `--generate <i>` or `-g <i>` option. The default is set to `1`.

```sh
ai-commit --generate 5
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can set up to a maximum of `5` suggestions.

### Applying [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

Many projects have rules for commit messages based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). If you want to apply these rules, set `conventional` with the `--type` or `-t` option.

```sh
ai-commit --type conventional
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> By setting it in the configuration, you can always apply the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) commit message rules.

## Configuration

```sh
